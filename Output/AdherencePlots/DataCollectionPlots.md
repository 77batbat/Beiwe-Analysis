Before creating data collection/adherence plots for your study, the GPS needs to be processed.

The following demonstration will show how to create data collection plots for your study in R.

The source location should point to the location of the [`AdherencePlots.R`](https://github.com/onnela-lab/Beiwe-Analysis/blob/master/Output/AdherencePlots/AdherencePlots.R) file on your local machine.
```
source("C:/Users/Ian/Documents/Work/JP/Beiwe/Github/Beiwe-Analysis/Output/AdherencePlots/AdherencePlots.R")
```

The `fildir` variable should point to the location of the Beiwe data for your study.
```
fildir="C:/Users/Ian/Documents/Work/JP/Schizophrenia/Data"
```

The  `plotname` variable is the output file name that will contain the data collection plots for your study. It needs to have the pdf extension.
```
plotname="DataCollectionPlot-12-12-16.pdf"
```
