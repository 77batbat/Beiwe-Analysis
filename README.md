# Introduction
`Beiwe-Analysis` is our GitHub code repository for analyzing Beiwe and collaborator data.  This is largely an effort of Ian and Patrick, but we intend to include any other efforts as well.  These efforts are closely related to Matt's `beiwedata`, and we plan to merge our efforts in the future.
